## Introduction
I was inspired by this <a href="https://youtu.be/kzwT3wQWAHE">video</a> and took some help from this <a href="https://www.karlsims.com/rd.html">webpage</a>! 

## Controls 
Just hover around and click your ```Left Mouse Button```! Additionally you can clear the whole grid by pressing ```Enter``` and pause the simulation by pressing the ```Space Bar```!

## Notes
Change the Feed and Kill rates to see variations!
